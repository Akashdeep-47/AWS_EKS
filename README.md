Deployment of webapp(wordpress) in AWS EKS
# AWS_EKS

Amazon EKS (Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes) - Allows you to use Kubernetes on AWS without installing and managing your own Kubernetes control plane.
EKS itself manages the master node privately inside its own infrastructure. Only we have to worry about our slave environment( like instance-type).
Here, we can launch various instance-types of the slave environment also knowns as nodeGroups, and inside this nodeGroups, we can launch as many nodes of various instance-type.

# Benefits of using AWS-EKS
1. Easy to use.
2. Flexible.
3. Cost-effective.
4. Reliable.
5. Scalable and high-performance.
6. Secure
